This is a simple Shiny app visualizing Covid19 case, death and recovery numbers on a World choropleth map. It uses Johns Hopkins University [dataset](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).
Type of the statistics and time period can be chosen on the control panel.
Tapping/Clicking on a country triggers a plot of that country below the input lists.
The app can be viewed at [here](https://hhekim.shinyapps.io/Covid19/).
